# Question Answering Site with Transformers

Welcome to this repository! Here, we will be creating a website that deals with a form using the `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` model. This site will allow us to provide both context and a question as input to the form, and it will generate an answer to the question based on the given context. To achieve this, we'll be using the Transformer library.

## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have the Transformer library installed. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aliraqimustafa/InforExtract2QA.git
cd InforExtract2QA
```
Run the ```app.py``` script to start the application.
```bash
python app.py
```
Now you're all set! You can access the website and use it to extract information from context to answer your questions.
